## Do you want to know more about me? Below would probably give you some shades of me.

### What do you love to do in your spare time?

Professionally, I like checking out new technologies and see what are the design element of the project, and building new stuff using them. The most recent project that caught my attention is the Next.js Commerce project.

I am also an aspiring bodybuilder, I spent 4~5 days a week training and follow a customized training and diet routine I created and track/reflect on metrics from the past. Looking up content on various resources and learn how to become a better bodybuilder. My goal is to compete on stage at WNBF in a few years.

Besides fitness, I am also a coffee enthusiast. My simple daily pleasure is to brew a precisely measured (20g beans, 300ml water@ 90celcus) cup of single-origin 3 stages pour-over style cup of coffee resulting in rich aroma, fruity acidity, medium body, and delicate finish. I am a fan of Ethiopia and Central America origins.

### What was the funniest thing you've done recently?

I am lactose intolerant but still can not resist the temptation of bubble tea so I had a bad stomach afterward üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### What drives you nuts?

When things are not organized... I would not identify myself as OCD, but I'll have to clean up things that are not put in an organized way.

### What is the most reckless thing you've done in the last 5 years?

Traveling to more than 40 countries and 80+ cities around the world to many different events, conferences, and shows. It was super fun and exciting but surely took a toll on my health.

### Describe the ideal culture you would like to be working in.

My ideal work environment is one where I'm can work with a team of passionate supportive individual who cares the company's mission. And as a team, building small achievable tasks together towards a big goal that could make a positive impact. I noticed this type of environment is most efficient to my productivity and keeps my motivation intact since the team is engaged with high morale. I believe the experience in working with such a culture would be full of a good memory.
