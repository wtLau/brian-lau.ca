### Hi, 你好~

#### I'm **Brian**! Nice to [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/brian-lau)-meet you :)

I am trying to offer mentorship to aspiring developers. I just started doing this, so please let me know if you have any tips!

#### About 🚩

My Competency:

- I have a good high-level understanding of most of the topics in the **[Front-end Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)**
- I have worked with multiple small product-focused companies in the past 3 years

I am Not:

- A recuiter, so I won't be able to provide you a job
- A [FAANG developer](https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/faang/)

I can probably be your mentor if you're:

- Confused about which programing language to start with
- Interested to learn more about what's it like to work as a front-end developer
- Looking for someone to review your portfolio
- Stuck with your progress and don't know what to do next

We can have a chat if you're:

- Interested to discuss any topics on the [Front-end Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
- Or anything else! Open to chat :)

#### Bio 👇

💼 **Professionally**, I am a web developer with an obsession for well-crafted design, building seamless experiences for users. I'm big on growth and teamwork. If we're gonna build the future, let's have some fun doing it!

🐱‍🏍 When I am not in front of a device, I spend my time in the gym, measuring my coffee-to-water extraction ratio on my V60 pour-over, and enjoying time with friends and family in Vancouver.

💡 I am an aspiring mentor on front-end development. If you have any questions that I might be able to help with, message me!
