üí° This was released on [My YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lauwangtatbrian), check it out at [Let's talk about JSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9ACV8yzo8&t=38s) üí° 

## What's JSX

## Why JSX

Before introducing JSX, I want you to think about how we can manipulate HTML?

![Untitled](/static/images/blog/jsx/Untitled%201.png)

To be able to dynamically change the content, we‚Äôd need some help from JS:

The setup

To actually update it:

Now its updated. Problem is, no one would write nor read this! We want something that‚Äôs Modular, Composable, Reusable.

In modern days, we have very good UX. So okay now think about this:

Sure, you‚Äôd want some sort of **tokens** to represent ****X**** to dynamically change it . This is where JSX shines!

## Facts

‚úÖ¬†JSX is actually a spec 

‚úÖ¬†**JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics**

‚úÖ¬†It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript

‚ùå¬† **It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the ECMAScript spec itself**

‚ùå¬† It's **NOT** intended to be implemented by engines or browsers

---

## And More ‚Ä¶

- Generic but well defined syntax enable parsers tools like:
    - Eslint, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prettier, and syntax highlighters etc
- Could co-exist with with other lib with a thin extension wrapper
- Could write JS logic in side the templates
- JSX is designed as an ECMAScript feature and the similarity to XML is only for familiarity
- Works for Server-Side-Render(SSR)

## Trade-off

- Embedding a new syntax in an existing language is not the plan. Therefore, it will always require a transpiler to have it work.

## Use Your Creativity üß†

How would you twist JSX to create something that solve your problem? For example 

- File extension
- Style classes
- Reference
- Reactivity
- Virtual DOM
- Reconciliation
- Control flow
- Sever rendering
- the list goes on‚Ä¶ :)
