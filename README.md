# Brian Lau's Porfolio App

Welcome! This is my personal app where fun things get built~

This is a clone of my porfolio [brian-lau.ca](https://github.com/wtLau/brian-lau.ca) to try out what it feels like to add End-to-end typesafe to my web app, as well as how easy is it to use it. The technology I am adopting is [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/) as I heard it numerous times from various sources, but in particular Theo.gg

## Goals

- Successfully adopt and migrate this Next.js app with tRPC
- Experience the power of end to end type safety
- How is it like to clone my own app and play around with it :)

cheers
